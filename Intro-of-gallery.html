        <div class="intro-text">We’re always trying to level up League, whether through new champions, items, and game modes, or a never-ending torrent of balance tweaks. Ever since we launched the game in 2009, we’ve been refining our champions and the fields on which they battle—all in an effort to deliver a memorable experience to players.

        <p id="invisible">League’s universe is one with few boundaries. It’s inhabited by magicians and gamblers, DJs and weather forecasters, yeti-riding children and time-traveling street urchins. League’s world is an all-encompassing collection of crazy ideas and classic archetypes defined by its breadth, its sheer range of possibility, and its celebration of cultural artifacts from around the world. It’s a dark place filled with danger and death, but it’s also colorful, welcoming, and even goofy at times. 
        <br></p>
        These pages are just a peek into our process. We will continue to challenge ourselves, dream out loud, and take risks as we venture forth to explore the vast reaches of the ever-unfolding League universe.
